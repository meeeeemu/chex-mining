# WIP: your save more than likely will break after updates depending on what i change, the game is still really early in alpha and the inventory system may not be perfect

because of this, you may need to reset your save after each update if the game fails to load

HOPEFULLY after v0.2.0, there shouldnt be a need anymore to do this

# Chex Mining - v0.2.1-alpha:
