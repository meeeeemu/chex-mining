# WIP: your save more than likely will break after updates depending on what i change, the game is still really early in alpha and the inventory system may not be perfect

# Chex Mining - v0.1.0-alpha:

Huge Developments Alert!!!

alot of cool stuff this update:

## New Pickaxe!! - Womboaxe

the first tier 4 in the game! here are the stats:

**Luck**: 0.25 <br />
**Speed**: 350 <br />
**Blocks Mined**: 2 <br />

soon exotics will be required for pickaxes.....

## Pickaxes can now mine Multiple Blocks!

that's right, your chexforge ravager is now equipped an awesome ability to simultaneously mine Two Blocks!

other pickaxes will take advantage of this later down the line when i add more pickaxes, but for now chexforge ravager
very much mines the most blocks!

## Pickaxe Changes:

Titanium Chexblaster - Luck - **70%** -> *50%* <br />
Chexforge Ravager - Speed - **1 every 0.1s** -> *1 every 0.2s* <br />

## Added Caves!

different caves have different rarities and contain 4 - 800 ores! caves ARE affected by luck boosts from pickaxes, and technically you do have a higher chance of finding caves with pickaxes that mine more (top tip!)

there are currently **three** different cave types, these being:

Standard Cave (1/2000 Chance when mining a block) <br />
Illuminous Cave (1/3500 Chance when mining a block) <br />
Astral Cave (1/5750 Chance when mining a block) <br />

(these chance of these might seem low, but they're really Really helpful)

these caves currently do not give you any special stuff or cave blocks, but they will in the future (oh no not cave exclusives no please)

## Recipe Buffs

because of the **INSANE** ease at which you can now get ores, the recipes have been buffed!

if you already own pickaxes, Congratulations! you managed to get them before the recipes were buffed, meaning you are a winner!

(this is mainly because of the caves, i had to actually nerf them from 2000 blocks to 800 blocks max because they were that busted)

## Rare Spawn Text!

when something happens some text will appear, including cave spawns! i also added a sound for when caves spawn, you can control the volume for this with the spawn effects volume.

dreamlike ores currently have a placeholder message while i think of some spawn messages for the dreamlike ores
